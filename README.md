Example feature exppansions

nvars - number of variables/attributes to expand/interact
order - how much to expand

We get (order +1) ^ nvars variables

For expansion of 1 variable:
```
nvars=1 order=0 const
nvars=1 order=1 const, cos(1* pi * x)
nvars=1 order=2 const, cos(2* pi * x)
```
For 2 variables we get this expansion:

nvars=2
```
const
cos pi y
cos pi x
cos pi (x+y)
cos pi (2y)
cos pi (2x)
cos pi (x + 2y)
cos pi (x + 2y)
cos pi (2x + 2y)
```
need to scale x between 0 and 1
or -1,1 and need to include sin() features
